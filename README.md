# ML-Movie-Recommendation-System

I have created the movie recommended system using machine learning approach (text vectorization (bag of words) with the help of sklearn class countVectorization.
# Step 1: convert our 'tags' column to vectors with the help of text vectorization (bag of words).
# Step 2: find the cosine distance between each of the vector to find the similarity.
# Step 3: Create a Recommend function which will return the 5 recommended movies.
